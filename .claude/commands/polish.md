Polish blog posts for clarity and flow while preserving the author's voice and quoted content.

**Core Process:**
1. If no file path is provided in $ARGUMENTS, find the most recent blog post in `_posts/`
2. Read the entire post carefully
3. Make improvements in sequence:
   - Fix grammar and spelling errors
   - Improve sentence flow and clarity
   - Enhance word choice for precision
   - Check tense and voice consistency
   - Tighten verbose passages
4. **NEVER modify content within quote blocks (lines starting with >)**
5. Preserve the author's personal voice and perspective
6. Keep technical terms and proper nouns intact
7. After initial polish, offer to improve specific sections if needed

**Focus Areas:**
- Replace weak verbs with stronger alternatives ("gave insights" → "clystalised insights")
- Eliminate redundant phrases ("not uncommon" → "common")
- Convert fractions to percentages ("1/4 less" → "25% less")
- Improve precision ("hole in the wall" → "vulnerability")
- Streamline awkward constructions ("Then he went on" → "Tao then applies")
- Use active voice where it helps clarity
- Keep professional yet conversational tone

**Title Options:**
If the post contains multiple insights, offer titles that:
- Clearly signal the structure ("Two Insights from...")
- Reference the source material when relevant
- Capture both main themes concisely
- Use natural, conversational language

**Ending Options:**
If the author wants ending alternatives, offer 3 options that:
- Include personal reflection on their work
- Connect back to broader themes in the post
- Provide forward-looking perspective
- Maintain authentic voice that is quietly confident and reflective

**Summary Format:**
After editing, provide a concise summary categorized by:
- **Clarity & Flow:** Structural improvements
- **Precision & Impact:** Word choice and phrasing improvements  
- **Conciseness:** Eliminated redundancies
- **Professional Tone:** Voice and style adjustments
