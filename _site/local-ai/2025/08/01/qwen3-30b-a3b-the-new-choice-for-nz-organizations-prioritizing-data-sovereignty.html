    <h2 id="the-recommendation-shift">The recommendation shift</h2>

<p>I’ve been asked by a number of New Zealand startups about the best local AI
model. For the past few months, I’ve recommended Llama 3.3 70B with 8-bit
quantization. I always ended my response with the caveat that it’s really a toy
model.</p>

<p>But With the arrival of <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-30b-a3b/">Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507</a>,
I think we finally have a local model that is good enough for both local exploration
and production use. Two things set this model apart from Llama 3.3 70B:</p>

<p><strong>Higher output quality</strong>. Based on my own benchmarks, Qwen3-30B’s performance
in Coding is slightly lower than ChatGPT-4o, but noticeably
higher than Claude’s haiku-3.5-20241022, a workhorse model that has been the
go-to for all my personal projects.</p>

<p><strong>Faster inference speed</strong>. Qwen3-30B-A3B runs at 78 tokens/second on M4 Max
with 128GB RAM (with MLX optimisation turned on). Previously, the biggest
problem I had with Llama-3.3-4-bit is its inference speed is only 7-10
tokens/second. It’s just a bit too slow for interactive use, particularly that
I’ve been trained to expect 52-68 tokens/second speed (as offered by claude’s
API). But 78? That’s more than usable.</p>

<p>Read on for a deep dive on 7 reasons why you should consider Qwen3-30B-A3B for
your local AI needs.</p>

<h2 id="1-benchmark-result-matching-larger-models">1. Benchmark result matching larger models</h2>

<p>Despite having just 30B parameters, Qwen3-30B-A3B competes with models 4-30 times its size:</p>

<p>For real-world applications, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/29/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507/">Simon Willison</a> confirms these results in practical applications, noting performance “approaching GPT-4o and larger Qwen models.”</p>

<h2 id="2-the-speed-advantage-through-moe-architecture">2. The speed advantage through MoE architecture</h2>

<p>Qwen3-30B-A3B uses the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Think of
Qwen3-30B-A3B as having 128 specialist consultants on staff, but only calling
on the 8 most relevant experts for each task.</p>

<p>This Mixture of Experts architecture means the full 30.5B parameters are
available when needed, but the model runs at the speed of a much smaller 3.3B
parameter system.</p>

<h2 id="3-almost-one-click-local-deployment">3. (Almost) one-click local deployment</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-MLX-8bit">MLX 8-bit
model</a>
is readily available, optimized specifically for Apple Silicon deployment.
Simon Willison’s <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/29/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507/">deployment
guide</a>
provides additional implementation details.</p>

<h2 id="4-production-deployment-made-affordable">4. Production deployment made affordable</h2>

<p>For GPU deployment, the best value is a [Mac Mini M4 Pro with 64GB
RAM]https://www.apple.com/nz/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini/apple-m4-pro-chip-with-12-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-24gb-memory-512gb). It gives 79 tokens/second with MLX optimization for $4,299 NZD.</p>

<p>Or, you can go with one or two <a href="https://www.pbtech.co.nz/product/VGAASU350901/ASUS-ROG-ASTRAL-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-5090-OC-GAMING">RTX 5090 (NZD $6,799 each on
PBTech)</a>
runs about 48 tokens/seconds.</p>

<h2 id="5-extended-context-window">5. Extended context window</h2>

<p>Qwen3-30B-A3B brings a 256K token context window to local deployment.</p>

<p>This compares favorably to alternatives: Llama 3.3 70B supports 128K tokens,
while Claude Haiku 3.5 offers 200K. The extra headroom matters when you’re
building applications that need to maintain context across extended
interactions or process substantial documentation in single passes.</p>

<h2 id="6-tool-use">6. Tool use</h2>

<p>Qwen3-30B-A3B brings excellent function calling capabilities to local
deployment—a feature notably absent in Llama 3.3 70B. Qwen3-30B-A3B simplifies
this with the <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent">Qwen-Agent framework</a>,
providing built-in support for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>MCP (Model Context Protocol)</strong> configuration for standardized tool definitions</li>
  <li><strong>Native tool integration</strong> including code interpreters and API calls</li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid thinking modes</strong> that switch between deep reasoning and fast response</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7-apache-20-licensing">7. Apache 2.0 licensing</h2>

<p>Qwen3-30B-A3B adopts the Apache 2.0 license, which is also a game-changer for
New Zealand startups. The Apache 2.0 license is one of the most permissive and
widely accepted open-source licenses, allowing you to use, modify, and
distribute the model with minimal restrictions. It’s the same license powering
many open source projects so your legal team probably already knows it.</p>

<p>This contrasts sharply with Llama’s custom license, which imposes user count
thresholds and revenue restrictions that can complicate commercial use.</p>

<h2 id="but-isnt-qwen3-from-china">But isn’t Qwen3 from China?</h2>

<p>Yes. But the beauty of local deployment lies in its complete neutrality.
Whether a model comes from Silicon Valley, Beijing, or Paris becomes irrelevant
when it runs exclusively on your hardware. Qwen3-30B-A3B offers the same data
sovereignty guarantees as any locally-deployed software: your data stays on
your servers, processed by your infrastructure, governed by your policies.</p>

<h2 id="your-evaluation-framework--model-choice">Your evaluation framework &gt; Model choice</h2>

<p>Before you get too excited about Qwen3-30B-A3B, let’s talk about the real
secret to success in AI: your evaluation framework.</p>

<p>The AI landscape changes weekly. New models, new capabilities, new price
points. Without a robust evaluation framework, you’re flying blind—making
decisions based on vendor marketing rather than measured performance. Build
your framework to answer three questions: Does this model solve our users’
actual problems? Can we measure improvement objectively? How do we capture
feedback to improve continuously? These capabilities matter more than which
model you choose today, because they determine how well you’ll adapt to
whatever comes next.</p>

<p>Think of AI models as engines and your evaluation framework as the vehicle
design. Anyone can buy the same engine, but how you integrate it, optimize it,
and apply it to specific use cases determines competitive advantage. Your
evaluation framework captures institutional knowledge that no model vendor can
replicate: understanding of your customers’ edge cases, industry-specific
quality standards, and the subtle differences between acceptable and
exceptional outputs in your domain.</p>

<p>While models depreciate rapidly—today’s state-of-the-art becomes tomorrow’s
baseline—your evaluation framework appreciates with use. Each test case
refined, each edge case captured, each performance metric validated adds to an
irreplaceable asset.</p>
