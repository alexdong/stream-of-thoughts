There are a few orthogonal axis one can use to measure a software engineer’s maturity. The one that easily comes to mind is technical knowledge, whether they have an accurate mental model of the language or technology they use. Do they know intuitively where the boundaries are. Another one is communication skill, whether they can understand and be understood. 

One important axis that often gets overlooked in many technical interviews is mental agility or mental flexibility. The ability to know that all “best practices” are context sensitive. The ability to hold back opinions until a good-enough understanding of a problem is completed because [nobody knows](https://www.seangoedecke.com/confidence/). This flexibility empowers engineers to shape the technical approaches according to the problem on hand. 

In Sean’s most recent essay on [software taste](https://seangoedecke.com/taste/), he mentioned:

> Almost every decision in software engineering is a tradeoff. You’re rarely picking between two options where one is strictly better. Instead, each option has its own benefits and downsides. Often you have to make hard tradeoffs between engineering values: past a certain point, you cannot easily increase performance without harming readability, for instance.
>
> Really understanding this point is (in my view) the biggest indicator of maturity in software engineering. Immature engineers are rigid about their decisions. They think it’s always better to do X or Y. Mature engineers are usually willing to consider both sides of a decision, because they know that both sides come with different benefits. The trick is not deciding if technology X is better than Y, but whether the benefits of X outweigh Y in this particular case.

Go ahead and read the full essay, it’s a great one. 

Now, One thing I believe we should all start doing, not only at the outset of a project, but also regularly review as the project develops, I think it's worth to regularly reflect on the values for the current projects we are working on and their trade-offs. This practice can help us maintain mental flexibility and adapt our approaches as needed.
