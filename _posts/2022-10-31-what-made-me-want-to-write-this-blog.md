Hey Mia,

Here is why I decided to write this blog.

I was listening to [The only COVID-19 book worth
reading](https://podcasts.apple.com/nz/podcast/people-i-mostly-admire/id1525936566?i=1000551594029).
The conversation was mainly about Michael Lewis's book on COVID-19 and CDC.  But
towards the end, Michael shared the story of losing his daughter to a car
accident. 

Standing there by the strawberry patch, I remain motionless for a few minutes. 
Overwhelmed by the sadness for Michael.

Life is unpredictable. Life is short. life is fragile. And we can't do anything
about it.

By the time you reach 45, which is how old I am when I am writing this sentence,
I would be 82 years old. And there is a 50-50 chance that I won't be here for you.
(NZ's [male average life expectency is 82](https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/growth-in-life-expectancy-slows/).)

It scares me to realise that I won't be here with you. The possibility has
always been here but I have never really thought about it until hearing about
Michael's story. 

So at that moment, I promised myself that I will start writing down what is
happening in our life; what has been going through in my mind everyday, and what
challenges I'm facing and how I dealt with it. 

I hope that one day in the future, when you wake up and say to yourself "I
really wish I can talk to daddy now", you can find me speaking to you thorugh
these writings.
