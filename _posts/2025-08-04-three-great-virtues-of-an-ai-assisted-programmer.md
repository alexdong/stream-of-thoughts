Larry Wall, the creator of Perl langauge, famously said that laziness,
impatience, and hubris are the three great virtues of a programmer. These three
"virtues" turns out to be a great hiring advice because laziness drove us to
automate the mundane, which translates to discover new optimisation
opportunities; impatience pushed us toward more performant, often simpler and
more elegant, solutions; hubris gave us the courage, or stupidity, to work on
problems others couldn't solve.

How about AI-assisted programmers?

Sean Goedecke proposes a compelling answer. He argues that AI-assisted
programmers need the following virtues:

> - Obsession to keep your own mind working at the problem
> - Impatience to eject and work it out yourself
> - Suspicious of what the AI is doing
