Larry Wall famously declared that laziness, impatience, and hubris are the three great virtues of a
programmer. These qualities drive us to automate repetitive tasks, build efficient solutions, and
write maintainable code. 

But what happens when AI enters the picture?

Sean Goedecke suggests that AI-assisted programmers need different virtues:
> - Obsession to keep your own mind working at the problem
> - Impatience to eject and work it out yourself
> - Suspicious of what the AI is doing

Now, how can you find these out in a traditional job interview? You can't.
