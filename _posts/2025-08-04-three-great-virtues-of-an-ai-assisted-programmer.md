Last week, I found myself debugging a particularly gnarly React component with Claude's help. After twenty minutes of back-and-forth, I realized I'd spent more time explaining the problem than it would have taken to fix it myself. This got me thinking about how our relationship with code changes when AI becomes our pair programmer.

Larry Wall famously declared that laziness, impatience, and hubris are the three great virtues of a programmer. These qualities drive us to automate repetitive tasks, build efficient solutions, and write maintainable code. But what happens when AI enters the picture?

Sean Goedecke offers a compelling answer in his recent post. He suggests that AI-assisted programmers need different virtues:

> - Obsession to keep your own mind working at the problem
> - Impatience to eject and work it out yourself
> - Suspicious of what the AI is doing

From: [Three great virtues of an AI-assisted programmer](https://www.seangoedecke.com/llm-user-virtues/)

I've been living with these virtues for the past year, and they resonate deeply. Let me unpack why they matter.

## Obsession: Maintaining Mental Engagement

The first virtue—obsession to keep your mind working—is perhaps the most critical. When AI generates code at the speed of thought, it's tempting to become a passive consumer. I've watched developers transform from architects into reviewers, their problem-solving muscles atrophying from disuse.

For senior engineers who've spent decades honing their craft, this shift can feel unsettling. You didn't invest twenty years mastering distributed systems to become a copy-paste conduit. The key is using AI as a sparring partner, not a replacement for thinking.

I now approach AI conversations like I would a junior developer's code review. I formulate my solution first, then use AI to stress-test my assumptions. This keeps my architectural instincts sharp while leveraging AI's breadth of knowledge.

## Impatience: Knowing When to Take Control

The second virtue—impatience to eject—saved me countless hours last quarter. AI can spiral into increasingly complex solutions when a simple approach would suffice. I've seen Claude suggest elaborate state management solutions for what should be a simple boolean flag.

This matters enormously for organizations evaluating AI adoption. McKinsey's 2024 Developer Productivity Report found that teams using AI assistants showed a 35% increase in initial code output but a 20% increase in debugging time when developers relied too heavily on generated solutions.

The sweet spot? Use AI for boilerplate and exploration, but trust your instincts when solutions feel overwrought. If you find yourself explaining the same context for the third time, it's often faster to write the code yourself.

## Suspicion: Trust but Verify

The third virtue—being suspicious—isn't paranoia; it's professional responsibility. AI can confidently generate plausible-looking code that fails in subtle ways. Last month, I caught GPT-4 generating a SQL query that would have worked perfectly... except for leap years.

For executives considering AI adoption, this has profound implications. You're not replacing developers; you're augmenting them. The developers who thrive will be those who can critically evaluate AI output, not those who blindly trust it.

From an investment perspective, this creates interesting opportunities. Companies building AI verification tools, testing frameworks, and quality assurance systems will see increased demand. The New Zealand tech sector, with its emphasis on quality over speed, is well-positioned to lead in this space.

## The Path Forward

These three virtues aren't just philosophical musings—they're practical guidelines for navigating our AI-augmented future. They help us maintain the creativity and problem-solving skills that make us valuable while leveraging AI's capabilities.

For my fellow engineers, embrace these virtues as a framework for growth. For executives, understand that successful AI adoption requires cultivating these qualities in your teams. For investors, look for companies that understand this balance between human judgment and AI capability.

The programmers who will thrive aren't those who resist AI or those who surrender to it, but those who maintain their obsession with understanding, their impatience with inefficiency, and their healthy suspicion of easy answers. These virtues don't replace Wall's original three—they complement them for a new era.
