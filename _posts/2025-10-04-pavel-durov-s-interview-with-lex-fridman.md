Pavel's sincerity (when he recounted the interaction with the French Intelligence service), strong ethical foundation (when asked about what would happen if he is sentenced to 20 years in prison, he said he would starve to death to "reboot" the game rather than give in), and his slow, precise, and deliberate responses are a fresh breeze in an industry that has so much hot air.

I am a fan.
