There are not many articles that capture the experience of working, or seeing your loved ones work, in a large software company like [Seeing like a Software Company](https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company/). 

This essay builds on the ideas from [Seeing like a State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State) by James C. Scott. The key idea is that large organizations need to make work "legible" in order to manage it at scale. This often means breaking down complex tasks into simple, measurable, and standardized components. While this makes it easier to manage, it can also lead to a loss of nuance and a disconnect from the actual work being done.

> Modern organizations exert control by maximising “legibility”: by altering the system so that all parts of it can be measured, reported on, and so on.
> However, these organizations are dependent on a huge amount of “illegible” work: work that cannot be tracked or planned for, but is nonetheless essential.
> Increasing legibility thus often actually lowers efficiency - but the other benefits are high enough that organizations are typically willing to do so regardless.

> James C. Scott was writing about the “high modernist” movement in governance that produced (among other things) the tidy German forests of the 19th century1. In order to produce wood at scale, the German state demanded legibility: forests that an inspector could visit to tally up the amount of healthy trees. That means that you must be able to walk through the forest - i.e. the underbrush must be controlled - and the trees ought to be ideally laid out in neat rows of a single type.
>
> Proponents of legibility often describe their processes as “efficiency measures” or ways to “avoid waste”. But overall, the new “efficient” forests were in fact far less efficient than the old, illegible forests. They produced less wood per year and required more effort to fight disease, because the underbrush proved surprisingly load-bearing to the health of the soil, and the variety of species turned out to have been an asset. The new homogeneous forests could be wiped out by a single parasite or disease in a way that the older, more varied forests could not.
>
> However, the advantages of legibility are enormous. Once you know exactly how many trees you have, you can plan ahead, make large trade deals, avoid graft, and so on. To me, this is the most interesting point Scott makes. Large organizations did genuinely think that more legibility would necessarily increase efficiency. But even when it became clear that that was false, those organizations continued pushing for legibility anyway, because the other advantages were too powerful.

> Why don’t large companies react to this by doing away with all of their processes? Are they stupid? No. The processes that slow engineers down are the same processes that make their work legible to the rest of the company. And that legibility (in dollar terms) is more valuable than being able to produce software more efficiently.
>
> Why are these capabilities so valuable to a large software company, when small software companies can do without them? This is leaving my area of expertise somewhat, but I’m pretty sure the main answer is large enterprise deals. Making deals with large enterprise customers is fantastically profitable. Any sufficiently large SaaS will thus pivot from small customers to enterprise customers, if it can. But enterprise deals (a) can take many, many months to set up, and (b) require making long-term feature commitments. An illegible company is not configured to be able to stick with a boring enterprise deal for many months, constantly answering questions and delivering features. Large enterprise customers simply won’t trust a small software company to deliver the things they need over the next year or two.

> Customers like this typically value legibility very highly, and so demand that their vendors also be legible. In fact, highly legible organizations struggle to communicate at all with organizations that are less legible (and vice versa). They don’t have access to the right bona fides, they don’t talk the same language, and so on. This puts real pressure on growing tech companies to become more legible, even if it hurts their ability to deliver software.
