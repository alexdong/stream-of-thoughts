Blue teams are builders who create orders from chaos, while red teams are
invaders who finds inconsistencies, the weakest link, in a coherent whole and
punch holes in it. 

An unexpected insight is red teams compound faster.

From organisational design perspective, slightly weird/unconventional
contributors are more suitable for playing the red team role.
