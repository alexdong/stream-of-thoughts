Today, I printed out a quote from Emerson and put onto our fridge 
so we can all look at it everyday.

> To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and
> the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics
> and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to
> find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a
> healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know
> even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to
> have succeeded."
