    <p>Terence Tao wrote about blue and red teams in the context of working with AI.

<blockquote>
  <p>In the field of cybersecurity, a distinction is made between the “blue team”
task of building a secure system, and the “red team” task of locating
vulnerabilities in such systems.  The blue team is more obviously necessary
to create the desired product; but the red team is just as essential, given
the damage that can result from deploying insecure systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blue teams are builders who create orders from chaos, while red teams are
invaders who finds inconsistencies, the weakest link, in a coherent whole and
punch holes in it.</p>

<p>An unexpected insight is red teams compound faster. From an organisational
design perspective, slightly weird/unconventional contributors are more
suitable for playing the red team role.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nature of these teams mirror each other; mathematicians would call them
“dual”.  The output of a blue team is only as strong as its weakest link: a
security system that consists of a strong component and a weak component
(e.g., a house with a securely locked door, but an open window) will be
insecure (and in fact worse, because the strong component may convey a false
sense of security).  Dually, the contributions to a red team can often be
additive: a red team report that contains both a serious vulnerability and a
more trivial one is more useful than a report that only contains the serious
issue, as it is valuable to have the blue team address both vulnerabilities.</p>
